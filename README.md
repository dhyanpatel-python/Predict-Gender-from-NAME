# Gender Prediction Website

Welcome to the Gender Prediction Website! This web application allows you to predict the genders of individuals based on their names. The predictions are limited to two categories: MALE and FEMALE. In cases where the algorithm cannot accurately calculate the gender or is unsure, it will display NULL along with the probability of being correct.

## How it Works

1. Input Name: Enter the first name of the individual whose gender you want to predict in the provided input box.

2. Predict Gender: Click on the "Predict" button to initiate the gender prediction process.

3. Results: The system will display the predicted gender, which can be either MALE, FEMALE, or NULL if the prediction is uncertain. Along with the prediction, you will also see the probability of the prediction being correct.

## Algorithm and Accuracy

Our gender prediction algorithm is based on a combination of statistical methods and machine learning techniques. It has been trained on a large dataset of names and corresponding genders to make accurate predictions. However, it's essential to understand that names can be ambiguous, and there might be cases where the algorithm cannot provide a confident prediction.

The accuracy of the predictions may vary depending on the name's popularity, cultural context, and other factors. The website will display the probability score along with the prediction, which represents the algorithm's confidence in its prediction. Higher probability scores indicate a more confident prediction, while lower scores indicate a higher degree of uncertainty.

## Privacy and Data

We take user privacy and data protection seriously. We do not store any personal information entered on the website, including the names used for gender prediction. All predictions and probability scores are generated in real-time and are not retained in our systems.

## Feedback and Improvements

We are continuously working to improve the accuracy and performance of our gender prediction algorithm. Your feedback is invaluable to us in this endeavor. If you encounter any incorrect predictions or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to contact us through the provided contact information on the website.

## Disclaimer

Please be aware that gender prediction based on names is a statistical estimation and might not always be accurate. Names can be used by individuals of any gender, and cultural variations can further complicate the prediction process. The website's primary purpose is for entertainment and educational purposes, and the predictions should not be considered definitive or used for making significant decisions.
